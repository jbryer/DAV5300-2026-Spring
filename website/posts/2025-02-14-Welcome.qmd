Welcome to DAV 5300! Couple of important notes as you get started:

* The course syllabus located on this website here: [https://`r tolower(semester)``r year`.dav5300.net/course/syllabus.html](https://`r tolower(semester)``r year`.dav5300.net/course/syllabus.html) We will post all course materials there. Canvas will be used primarily for submitting assignments. Please read the syllabus carefully! Send us any questions you may still have about the course.

* Complete this [Google Form](`r formative_assessment`) as soon as possible. We will use some of the data (in aggregate) in the meetup.

* Once you go through the syllabus, try starting Lab 1 as soon as you can. This will require you to install R and RStudio and will help get you get acquainted with R. See the software page for more information about the software we will use for this course.

I am looking forward to getting to know everyone and a fantastic semester! Good luck!
